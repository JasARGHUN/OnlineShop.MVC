Project wroted in ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC (full CRUD/admin/account/role and more)
You need to migrate database. Just write this in Package Manager Console.
Step - 1) update-database -context ApplicationDbContext
Step - 2) update-database -context AppIdentityDbContext
Step - 3) admin login: progmd@mail.ru, password 111111Test. If you want to change it, go to Models/AppIdentity and do what you want to do.
And good luck my unknow friend!
